# RDLRT Stakepool for Cardano

A simplistic pool operator who is here to hope contribute better to the ecosystem. I am not big on marketing my pool - or try to use my pool as "business" (as for my understanding of origins of why decentralised blockchain is created, it runs in conflict with a business model beyond a basic compensation of resources spent). But ofcourse, running a pool pays - my intention is not to have a successful pool (in the sense most financially motivated individuals would) :smile: .

## FAQ

- I cannot find any mention of your pool online. Why dont you have a website?  

  If you're delegating to RDLRT pool, you're likely not coming from a website or hear-say - hopefully , the chances are that you saw some contributions to ecosystem beyond the usual (performance, fees, ads, freebie tokens, airdrops) realms, which would be more satisfactory outcome for me. This does mean that gradually pool performs not so optimally, but that's alright. The pool itself can continue without any delegations (even as delegations die off) , as long as the blockchain does not reach the threshold for sacrificing important security parameters.
If you do want to reach out - you can always reach me on [Telegram](https://t.me/clio_rdlrt_undr) - any updates to the pool parameters will be made on this channel only. The group itself is a joint communication group between 3 indepedent pool operators who share similar ethos for the ecosystem.  

- Why are you not on twitter or other social media platforms?  

  More often than not, my experience for such platforms is it is either dominated by very loud - [g]literally - personnels (regardless of truthfulness), often modifying theories using an echo chamber that agrees with similar bias, not my cup of tea. I am always more than happy to have one-to-one conversation - or help out with discussions in technical channels, but as far as online presence goes - I would much rather focus on what I do better ðŸ™‚

- Why do you have 3% pool fees , when most work alright at 0-1% fees?  

  There is more to pool than pool fee being used as an indicator to attract stake (the protocol itself does not distinguish pools very highly based on pool fees), and it is unhealthy that pool operators race to ground with respect to pool fees, and then run abnormal tactics to gain compensation for their time. Instead, it's much better to use the fees as it was designed to.
  
- Would you consider opening a second pool if saturated?  

  Strictly not ðŸ™‚ The delegation specs incentivise pools imply (to my reading) to grow operator fees to redistribute stake off an honest operator. Unfortunately , the term 'honest' is very vague and subject to interpretations - my bias is to help redistribute the delegators to other builders instead, as there are tons of folks who might find it useful.

- Where can I see what you're working on?  

  Besides my employment work , most of the work within this ecosystem will be either in technical groups on tg/stackoverflow/(previously also in forum) OR on github. The most common projects I'd assist with are [guild-operators](https://cardano-community.github.io) and [Koios](https://koios.rest).
